- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @THorne93

I don't beleive in sharing over exaggerated nonsense like how "I have contributed towards the development of an interactive developmental workspace in which cross-collaboration meets strategic planning which in turn results in empowered collaboration  growth".

I program and write code. Sometimes it works.
